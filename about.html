                    <p class="lead">Founded in 2015 by Christian Flores, Lakewood Roof Repair has grown from a small family operation to Pierce County's most trusted roofing and restoration company.</p>
                    
                    <p>What started as a commitment to provide honest, quality roofing services has evolved into a comprehensive restoration company that helps homeowners through some of their most challenging times. Whether it's storm damage, fire restoration, or routine maintenance, we treat every home like our own.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our team, led by Christian and sales expert Lia, brings decades of combined experience in roofing, restoration, and insurance claims assistance. We're not just contractors – we're your neighbors, committed to protecting Pierce County homes and families.</p>
